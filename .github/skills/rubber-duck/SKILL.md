# Rubber Duck Debugging: The Junior Developer Explanation Method

This skill implements a proven debugging technique: by forcing yourself (or Claude) to explain code in exhaustive detail to someone who knows nothing, you catch bugs that skip past normal code review.

The premise is simple: **If you can't explain what your code does in every scenario, you don't fully understand it—and that's where bugs hide.**

## Core Principle

Treat every code explanation as if you're teaching someone on their first day who will ask uncomfortable questions like:
- "What happens if that's null?"
- "Could a user break this?"
- "What if this runs 10,000 times per second?"
- "Why did you assume that would always be true?"

## How to Use This Skill

### For Single Code Segments
Paste your code snippet and Claude will:
1. Explain what each part does in plain language
2. Identify assumptions and where they could fail
3. Point out edge cases you haven't handled
4. Highlight security, performance, and reliability issues
5. Suggest specific test cases you should write

### For Entire Repositories
Provide the repo structure or key files and Claude will:
1. Map the code architecture and data flow
2. Identify brittleness points where failures cascade
3. Find coupling issues that make bugs hard to track
4. Spot patterns that indicate technical debt
5. Highlight areas most likely to have hidden bugs

## Explanation Framework by Code Type

### API Endpoints
**The Junior Dev Questions:**
- What happens if someone sends malformed JSON?
- What if they omit required fields?
- What if they send the request 1000 times in a second?
- Could they inject SQL, NoSQL queries, or shell commands?
- What happens when the database is slow or down?
- How does this handle concurrent requests to the same resource?
- What if the authentication token is expired but not detected?
- Could someone access data they shouldn't by manipulating IDs?

**What to Explain:**
```markdown
1. **Request Flow**: Trace from request arrival to response
2. **Validation**: What checks exist? What's missing?
3. **Authentication & Authorization**: Who can call this? How is it verified?
4. **Rate Limiting**: What stops abuse?
5. **Error Handling**: What happens when things fail?
6. **Side Effects**: What else does this change in the system?
7. **Rollback Strategy**: If this fails midway, what's left in a bad state?
8. **Load Behavior**: What breaks under 100, 1000, 10000 concurrent requests?
```

### Database Queries
**The Junior Dev Questions:**
- What happens with 0 rows? 1 row? 1 million rows?
- Is this query N+1 territory?
- What if someone deleted the foreign key record between queries?
- Could this lock tables under load?
- What's the explain plan say? (Are we doing a table scan?)
- What happens if the transaction times out?
- Could this deadlock with other queries?

**What to Explain:**
```markdown
1. **Query Plan**: Is this using indexes? Scanning entire tables?
2. **Result Set Size**: How many rows typically? At maximum?
3. **Locking Behavior**: What locks does this acquire? For how long?
4. **Transaction Boundaries**: Where does it commit? What if it rolls back?
5. **Race Conditions**: What happens if two run simultaneously?
6. **Missing Data**: What if the JOIN returns nothing?
7. **Performance Degradation**: When does this get slow?
8. **Connection Pooling**: Does this hold connections longer than needed?
```

### Async/Promise Code
**The Junior Dev Questions:**
- What happens if the promise rejects?
- Do you have an unhandled rejection floating around?
- What's the execution order really?
- Could these run in the wrong order?
- What if the API takes 5 minutes to respond?
- Are you leaking memory by not cleaning up event listeners?
- What happens if the user navigates away mid-operation?

**What to Explain:**
```markdown
1. **Execution Order**: Step through EXACTLY when each thing runs
2. **Error Propagation**: How do errors bubble up? Where are they caught?
3. **Cancellation**: Can this be stopped? Should it be?
4. **State Management**: What if state changes while waiting?
5. **Memory Leaks**: What's held in closures? Does it get released?
6. **Retry Logic**: What happens on timeout or failure?
7. **Race Conditions**: Can multiple calls interfere with each other?
8. **Zombie Callbacks**: Could this callback fire after component unmounts?
```

### UI/Component Code
**The Junior Dev Questions:**
- What happens if props change while rendering?
- What if the user clicks the button 10 times in 1 second?
- What if the API returns an error or empty data?
- Could the component re-render infinitely?
- What happens on slow networks or offline?
- What if props are undefined or null?
- Does this cause unnecessary re-renders of children?

**What to Explain:**
```markdown
1. **Render Cycle**: When does this re-render? Why?
2. **State Updates**: Are they batched? Could they race?
3. **Props Changes**: What happens when each prop changes?
4. **Event Handling**: What if events fire rapidly or unexpectedly?
5. **Loading States**: How does the user know something is happening?
6. **Error States**: What displays when things fail?
7. **Edge Cases**: Empty lists? Missing data? Very long strings?
8. **Performance**: Does this cause unnecessary expensive operations?
9. **Memory**: Are event listeners and subscriptions cleaned up?
10. **Accessibility**: Can keyboard and screen reader users use this?
```

### Authentication & Authorization Code
**The Junior Dev Questions:**
- Could someone bypass this by tampering with cookies/tokens?
- What if the session expires mid-request?
- Could someone escalate privileges?
- What happens if the auth service is down?
- Are passwords/secrets logged anywhere?
- Could timing attacks reveal valid usernames?
- What if someone's permissions change while they're logged in?

**What to Explain:**
```markdown
1. **Token/Session Validation**: How is identity verified? Where could it fail?
2. **Permission Checks**: Who can access what? Are checks server-side?
3. **Secrets Management**: Where are secrets stored? Are they exposed in logs/errors?
4. **Attack Vectors**: What could a malicious user try?
5. **Session Management**: How long do sessions last? How are they invalidated?
6. **Fallback Behavior**: What happens when auth services are unavailable?
7. **Audit Trail**: Is access logged? Could that logging be defeated?
```

### Batch/Background Jobs
**The Junior Dev Questions:**
- What happens if this runs twice simultaneously?
- What if it crashes halfway through?
- How do you know if it succeeded or failed?
- What if the data it's processing changes while running?
- Could this run indefinitely?
- What happens when it processes more data than expected?

**What to Explain:**
```markdown
1. **Idempotency**: Can this safely run multiple times?
2. **Partial Completion**: What's the state if it fails midway?
3. **Recovery**: How do you restart or resume?
4. **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, connections—what are the limits?
5. **Timing**: How long should this take? What's the timeout?
6. **Monitoring**: How do you know if it's stuck or failed?
7. **Data Consistency**: What if source data changes during processing?
8. **Concurrency**: What prevents two instances from conflicting?
```

### Configuration/Infrastructure Code
**The Junior Dev Questions:**
- What happens if this config value is wrong?
- Could someone inject commands through environment variables?
- What's the default if this isn't set?
- Will this work across dev/staging/prod?
- What happens if secrets aren't available?
- Could a typo bring down production?

**What to Explain:**
```markdown
1. **Required Values**: What MUST be set? What are sensible defaults?
2. **Validation**: How do you know if config is valid before using it?
3. **Security**: Could config be used to inject code or access secrets?
4. **Environment Differences**: Does this work in all environments?
5. **Change Impact**: What breaks if this config changes?
6. **Secrets**: How are secrets accessed? Could they leak?
7. **Failure Modes**: What happens with missing or malformed config?
```

## Red Flags to Always Look For

When explaining any code, actively hunt for these common bug patterns:

### Trust Issues
- **User Input**: Do we trust it? Is it validated, sanitized, rate-limited?
- **External APIs**: Do we handle errors, timeouts, schema changes?
- **Environment Variables**: Are defaults safe? Is validation present?
- **Database Data**: Could it be null, empty, malformed, huge?

### State Problems
- **Race Conditions**: Can two operations interfere?
- **Stale Data**: Could cached data be out of date?
- **Orphaned State**: What if a cleanup operation doesn't run?
- **Implicit State**: Are we depending on order of operations?

### Resource Management
- **Memory Leaks**: Are listeners, timers, subscriptions cleaned up?
- **Connection Pools**: Do connections get released?
- **File Handles**: Are files/streams closed on all paths?
- **Locks**: Could we deadlock? Is there a timeout?

### Error Handling Gaps
- **Unhandled Exceptions**: What throws that we don't catch?
- **Ignored Errors**: Do we log errors but then continue?
- **Error Swallowing**: Do we catch errors and do nothing?
- **Cascading Failures**: Does one failure cause a chain reaction?

### Performance Traps
- **N+1 Queries**: Do we query in a loop?
- **Unbounded Growth**: Can lists, logs, queues grow without limit?
- **Blocking Operations**: Do we wait synchronously for slow operations?
- **Missing Indexes**: Are we scanning large tables?

### Security Blindspots
- **Injection**: SQL, NoSQL, Command, XSS—where's user input used?
- **Authorization**: Are checks only client-side?
- **Secrets Exposure**: Could secrets leak through logs, errors, URLs?
- **IDOR**: Could users access resources by changing IDs?

## Output Format

For each code segment, provide:

1. **Plain English Summary**: What this code is supposed to do
2. **Line-by-Line Walkthrough**: Explain each significant part
3. **Assumptions & Dependencies**: What MUST be true for this to work
4. **Edge Cases Identified**: Scenarios that aren't handled
5. **Potential Bugs**: Specific things that could go wrong
6. **Attack Vectors**: How a malicious user could exploit this
7. **Performance Issues**: Where this could get slow or resource-intensive
8. **Test Cases Needed**: Specific tests that would catch these issues

## Example Response Pattern

```markdown
### What This Code Does
[Plain English explanation]

### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Line X-Y: [What it does, why it matters]
2. Line Z: [What it does, what could go wrong]

### Critical Assumptions
- Assumes that [X] is always [Y]
- Depends on [Z] being available
- Expects data in format [A]

### Edge Cases Not Handled
- ❌ What if the input is null/empty?
- ❌ What happens with concurrent access?
- ❌ How does this behave under load?

### Bugs & Security Issues Found
🐛 **Bug**: [Specific issue]
   - Impact: [What breaks]
   - Reproduction: [How to trigger]
   - Fix: [What to change]

🔒 **Security**: [Vulnerability]
   - Risk: [What an attacker could do]
   - Mitigation: [How to fix]

⚡ **Performance**: [Issue]
   - When: [Conditions that trigger slowdown]
   - Why: [Root cause]
   - Solution: [Optimization approach]

### Recommended Tests
```typescript
describe('Component', () => {
  it('should handle null input gracefully', () => {
    // Test case that catches the bug
  });
});
```

### Questions for the Developer
- [ ] Have you tested this with [edge case]?
- [ ] What happens if [assumption] isn't true?
- [ ] How does this behave when [unusual condition]?


## Special Instructions

1. **Be Skeptical**: Question every assumption. If the code assumes something "will always be true," explain what happens when it isn't.

2. **Think Like an Attacker**: For any code that touches user input, network requests, or sensitive data, explicitly describe how a malicious user could abuse it.

3. **Consider Scale**: Everything works fine with 10 users. What breaks at 10,000? At 100,000?

4. **Trace Data Flow**: Follow data from entry point to storage/output. Where could it be corrupted, lost, or leaked?

5. **Surface Hidden Complexity**: If the code looks simple but depends on complex behavior elsewhere, call that out.

6. **Don't Assume Best Practices**: If error handling is missing, say so. If there's no validation, point it out. If it's not thread-safe, mention it.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

This skill is for debugging and catching bugs. Don't use it when:
- You just want the code to be written for you
- You want general programming advice
- You're looking for style or formatting improvements only
- You need help with an algorithm design (use this AFTER you have code)

## The Goal


By the end of the explanation, you should have:
- A clear mental model of what the code does
- A list of specific bugs and edge cases to fix
- Concrete test cases to write
- Awareness of security and performance implications
- Confidence that you understand every line

## Capture Bugs

When bugs are identified, document them clearly with:
- **Description**: What the bug is
- **Impact**: What breaks or could be exploited
- **Reproduction Steps**: How to trigger the bug
- **Suggested Fix**: What changes are needed to resolve it
- **Test Case**: A specific test that would catch this bug in the future

Remember: **If explaining the code reveals questions you can't answer, those questions are where bugs hide.**
